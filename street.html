   <p> "Street art has evolved from a rebellious act of vandalism to a celebrated form of self-expression. Murals,
    graffiti, and stencil art now adorn city walls, transforming drab urban landscapes into vibrant and
    thought-provoking canvases. From Banksy's clever subversions to Shepard Fairey's iconic Obey Giant, street artists
    continue to push boundaries and challenge social norms. As the art world increasingly recognizes the value and
    relevance of street art, it's clear that this once-marginalized movement has become a powerful force in shaping the
    cultural identity of our cities."</p>
